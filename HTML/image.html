      <strong>object-fit: cover</strong> : Behavior: The image is resized to
      fill the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will
      cover the entire container, but part of the image might be clipped
      (cropped) if its aspect ratio does not match the container's aspect ratio.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>object-fit: contain</strong> : Behavior: The image is resized to
      fit entirely within the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. The
      entire image will be visible, but there may be empty space (padding)
      around the image if the container has a different aspect ratio than the
      image.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>object-fit: fill</strong> : Behavior: The image is resized to fill
      the entire container, but it will stretch to match both the width and
      height of the container, regardless of its aspect ratio. This can distort
      the image if the aspect ratio of the container is different from the
      image.
